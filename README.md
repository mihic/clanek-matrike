# Matrix multiplication algorithms (from article)

This project consists of different matrix multiplication algorithms and tools for testing their correctness and time consumption. Project is the result of work in which we wanted to compare different simple algorithms for matrix multiplication. Here you can find the code and results that we presented in the article.

## Installation

This project is not meant for installation if your only goal is to have matrix multiplication. If you need only one algorithm for matrix multiplication you should download only the files (the file of your algorithm and its dependencies) that you need and include it in your project. 
Installation of whole project should be done if you want to replicate our work and confirm our results on your machine. This can be done by cloning the whole repository and run the make file which will generate main program. For this you need to have installed cpp compiler gcc and c++ library boost.

## Usage

This code can be used by people who need matrix multiplication in their project. In this project we compare different methods for matrix multiplication, you can chose algorithm which is best for your need. You can also use the code if you want to test your own matrix multiplication algorithm.

## Contributing

You can contribute to this project by adding additional algorithm for matrix multiplication. We will test the correctness and compare speed of your algorithm. Normally we will also and include it in our project.
